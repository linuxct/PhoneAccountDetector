<i>PhoneAccount Abuse Detector</i> is a simple application to enumerate and detect any application that (ab)uses adding an indefinite amount of PhoneAccount(s) to Android's TelecomManager.

What's the background of this? In short: malicious or even just improperly programmed applications can, intentionally or not, block your device from the ability to call emergency numbers. If you are in such a situation, this app helps you to find the culprit â€“ which you then can uninstall (of disable).
